# In the TestCases/ directory, we would like to
# ignore any of the data needed to run the cases
# or their output data, i.e., meshes, solution
# files, restart files, CSVs, etc. This will
# also be useful in that we can merge in the 
# independent TestCases/ repo that contains only
# this data without corrupting our current SU2/
# repo or accidentally commiting large file or
# changes to the meshes/solutions/restarts.

# Things appearing in TestCases/ repo to ignore:
*.su2
*.dat
*.vtk
*.csv
*.plt
*.pw
*.IGS
*.cgns
*.tgz
COPYING
README.md
*.autotest
config_*.cfg
*.ref*
*.eqn
*.pkl
