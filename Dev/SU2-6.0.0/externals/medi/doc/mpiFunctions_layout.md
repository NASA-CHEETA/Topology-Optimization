            [optinal] mpiName -> Defines the name that is used for the real mpi function in the generation process. If not defined the name of the function will be taken.
         [optinal] mediHandle -> Defines the handling type of MeDiPack for this function possible options are:
                                    transform: Preforms AD handling
                                      disable: Ignores the function
                                      handled: Ignores the function, but indicates that the function is handled in a wrapper.
                                      forward: Creates a define for the function forwarding.
                                       ignore: Ignores the function because it is not required.
                                      default: Just produce a forward handling to the normal MPI function. [default value]

              [optional] ranks,displs -> Indicate different layouts fo the buffer. Only one allowed.
                                  ranks -> Indicates that the forward buffer spans all ranks. E.g. Allgather
                                           The value defines the name of the communicator.
                                 displs -> Indicates that the buffer is defined by counts and displacements and switches
                                           therefore the generated code for the buffer.
                                           The value indicates the name of the displacement vector. The count attribute defines
                                           the name of the counts.
                       [optional] all -> Indicates that the buffer needs to span all ranks for the reverse operation. E.g. Allgather
                                         The value defines the name of the communicator.
                      [optional] root -> Indicates that the buffer only existas at the root process. The values defines the name
                                         argument that gives the root number.
                     [optional] const -> If defined indicates that the argument is constant. If set to opt the constant modifier is generated as optional.
                   [optional] inplace -> Indicates that the buffer can be MPI_IN_PLACE. The value of the field indicates
                                         name of the buffer that contains the data.
