# FRD-To-VTK Converter

The `frdToVTKConverter` converts a CalculiX results output file (in `.frd` format) to a `.vtk` file that can be read by e.g. Paraview. The converter was originally published on FreeCAD forum by user mamah:

The original converter was written in C# split over various files, and has been adapted into a single executable. The software `Mono` must be installed, which allows the running of C# executables in Ubuntu. The following commands must be run in a terminal to ensure the conversion of FRD to VTK. Disclosure: This converter has only been tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mono-complete
```

To make an executable of the supplied file `frdToVTKConverter.cs`, run:

```
mcs -out:frdToVTKConverter.exe frdToVTKConverter.cs
```

Then to run the converter to produce VTK files from an FRD file, run:

```
mono frdToVTKConverter.exe /path/to/frdFile.frd
```

When performing a conversion, the adapter will search for all data types that was saved in the `.frd` file (e.g. displacement, stress, strain etc.). After reading this list it will pause with the total number of timesteps that were read. The user must re-enter the number of timesteps into the terminal for the writing of the VTK files.
